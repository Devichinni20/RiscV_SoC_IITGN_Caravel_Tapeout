# Reset Pad Analysis – SCL-180 vs SKY130

## Purpose of This Document

This document studies reset pad behavior in the SCL-180 PDK and explains
why an on-chip POR is **not required**, unlike in SKY130.

---

## Reset Pad Behavior in SCL-180

In the SCL-180 PDK:
- Input pads are powered directly by VDD
- No internal enable signal is required
- No POR-gated input path exists
- Reset pins are asynchronous
- Reset pins are usable immediately after power-up

This guarantees that reset can be asserted during power ramp.

## Clean Reset Edge vs Power-Derived Reset

Digital flip-flops only require:
- Clean reset assertion
- Clean reset deassertion

They do **not** care:
- Where reset originated
- Whether reset was generated by POR or external pin

As long as reset timing requirements are met,
**the source of reset is irrelevant**.

---

## Why SKY130 Required On-Chip POR

In the SKY130 PDK:
- Pad behavior during power-up was not guaranteed
- Internal enables could be undefined
- Pull-ups and pull-downs were unreliable early
- Reset pins were not safe during initial power ramp

On-chip POR was required to:
- Mask pad uncertainty
- Delay reset release until power stabilized

---

## Why SCL-180 Does NOT Require POR

SCL-180 pads:
- Are electrically valid immediately after VDD
- Do not depend on internal enables
- Allow reset assertion from power-on

Thus, POR provides **no additional safety**.

## Technology Comparison Summary

| Feature | SKY130 | SCL-180 |
|------|--------|---------|
| Pad readiness after VDD | Delayed | Immediate |
| Reset reliability | POR-dependent | Pad-driven |
| Need for internal POR | Mandatory | Not required |

---

## Conclusion

An external reset pin is **architecturally sufficient** for SCL-180.

Using POR in this technology:
- Adds no functional benefit
- Introduces simulation–silicon mismatch
- Violates industry best practices
